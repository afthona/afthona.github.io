I am a doctoral student with the Chemical Engineering department at Columbia University. I am part of the Complex Resilient Intelligent Systems (CRIS) group of Prof. Venkat Venkatasubramanian. My core research areas include data-driven materials science and discovery, studying nature inspired algorithms like particle swarm optimization, and natural language processing for engineering systems. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2017.

Outside of academics, I am excited about running, swimming, and reading books!
