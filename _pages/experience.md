### Projects

**_Modeling Enhanced Enzyme Diffusion in the Presence of Substrates_**
_Sep 2019 - Nov 2019_
    * Modeled enhanced enzyme diffusion using a Bayesian data analysis framework in Python; used enzyme trajectories data obtained from single molecule imaging techniques for tracking enzyme movements
    * Evaluated possibility of anisotropic diffusion through a statistical hypothesis test using F-test on $x$ and $y$ displacements
    * Proposed Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations combined with k-means clustering for modeling diffusion for the different enzyme oligomerization forms; obtained probabilistic distributions capturing uncertainty in the estimates
    * Demonstrated significant variations in diffusion coefficients across the possible oligomerization states of the enzyme

**_Machine Learning for Sports Analytics with ESPNcricinfo_**
_Nov 2018 -- March 2019_
    * Used ESPN's ball-by-ball historical dataset for cricket matches in the past $15$ years to build a machine learning tool for predicting match scores, quantifying impactful match events, and generating 'smart statistics' for players
    * Implemented a recurrent neural network (RNN) and evaluated its performance in modeling the game dynamics
    * Built modules in Python for performing optimal balls-allocation between bowlers and batsmen, estimating wicket probability at a given state, and estimating match-win probabilities by factoring in both historical data and current state
    * Combined all the modules together to build an interactive match-simulation tool with quantification of impactful events
    * This tool was used by ESPNcricinfo during the Indian Premiere League 2019 and ICC World Cup 2019 worldwide

**_Anomaly Detection and Prediction for Aluminum Smelting Operations_**
_July 2018 - Oct 2018_
	* Built an L1 trend-extraction routine in Python with built-in hyperparameter estimation module for a piecewise linear trend extraction on any general time-series signal; core of the algorithm uses CVXOPT for optimization
	* Implemented a fuzzy variant of C-means clustering on the estimated linear trends to identify sub-optimal, or anomalous operating regimes through clustering of the operating regimes based on a pre-defined optimality criterion
	* Performed subspace angle comparisons between principal vectors to assess cluster separations and derive process insights
	* Integrated all the three modules as a Python package and shipped to the end user with Sphinx generated documentation

**_Optimal Filtering using PCA based Dynamic Models_**
_June 2016 â€“ May 2017_
    * Studied and implemented a novel identification technique called dynamic iterative principal component analysis (DIPCA) in MATLAB that takes in process data and estimates model order, parameters, and measurement error variances
    * Proposed a layered optimal data reconciliation and model validation approach based on an errors-in-variables Kalman-filter to handle dynamic input-output variables that the principal component analysis (PCA) framework is unable to handle
    * Demonstrated efficacy of this approach on a physical 'two-tank liquid level' case study in obtaining noise-free variable estimates and performing a selective model validation similar to residual analysis in classical system identification

**_Historical Data Mining and System Identification_**
_May 2015 - Aug 2015_
    * Implemented a novel segment identification algorithm in MATLAB to identify 'good regions' in historical databases
    * Comparatively analyzed an iterative-autoregressive exogenous (ARX) algorithm with the existing system identification algorithm at ABB; proposed changes to make the algorithm more robust towards high noise conditions
    *  Proposed unification of segment identification and iterative ARX algorithms for use in ABB's model identification toolbox

**_SARIMA modeling and Speech Data Analysis using Spectrogram_**
_July 2015 - Dec 2015_
	* Modeled monthly measles cases reported in New York City for the last $44$ years using R as a Seasonal ARIMA model
	* Implemented spectrogram approach in R to separate noise from an overlapping amplitude and frequency modulated signal
