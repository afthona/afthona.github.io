<p style="text-align: justify;">It was drizzling in the city and we were walking next to each other - enjoying the weather and discussing our plans for the night. The feeling of walking beside her and occasionally putting my arm around her was exactly what I had been craving for quite some time. I was totally immersed in the feeling and probably in a state of bliss. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly, out of nowhere, an auto-rickshaw drove past us and splashed an enormous amount of water on to us. This was something very similar to what we all must have seen in the movies. I was the one walking on the side closer to the road and hence, tried shielding her to the best I could but It didn't quite work. Her purse (maybe her dress too) got spoilt which was enough to make her mad and understandably so, because I was the one who thought it'd be a nicer if we walked to the cafe instead of calling a cab. Although she was furious mostly because of her <em>Caprese</em> bag, I wasn't really bothered and was in fact enjoying the moment. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Later that night, a thought struck the both of us - why don't we write about such experiences so that we could read them up later and relive the memories? The actual trigger for this thought might have been a movie called 'The Notebook' that she made me watch the previous night, showing a guy who writes 365 letters to his girlfriend. We realized that writing about our experiences, or about anything for that matter would be a beautiful hobby that the both of us should take up. Professionally too, it would help us in becoming more articulate, expressive, and obviously help me in writing better research papers in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyhow, getting splashed by that auto-rickshaw driver turned out to be a good thing for us. Had he not done that, we would probably never have thought of writing blogs for a long, long time.</p>
