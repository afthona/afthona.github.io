As the academic year comes to a close, a whole new generation of workforce is getting ready to enter the hyper-competitive job market. The constituents of this workforce are largely people who have worked really hard over the last few years and have been successful in securing a job right before graduating from college. However, little do most of these know what’s in store for them until they spend a considerable amount of time, which is usually a couple of years, treading this treacherous path in a totally unfamiliar environment.

If these future employees aren’t subservient, they are more likely to have a total disregard for the typical corporate culture and the dummies it produces over the years. Such people burn their fingers a tad bit early which sooner or later forces them to re-evaluate the worthiness of being surrounded by such mediocrity. The sheer importance that is given to a confined attitude, expressionlessness, inaction, and sycophancy is highly despising and intolerable for many. Gauging the extent to which this is prevalent and being successful in such an environment takes months, at least.


I had the misfortune of being around such mediocre dummies during my first job which I could tolerate for no longer than a year. The experience I had during this time is the primary motivation behind this post. However, I have had the luxury of working in another company as well which inspired me to compare the two experiences mentally and distill the learnings which I am penning down in this article. So, here are the things I learned in the last two years.

You don’t always get what you deserve; it’s up to you to fight for it
========================
There is always a misconception among people that the first job is most critical to anyone’s career and not landing an offer from one of the top companies pushes you towards failure. This line of thinking is blatantly flawed and inaccurate. How can one event decide everything a person can achieve in the next 35 years of a professional career? We all know about butterfly-effect and understand that given the dynamic nature of life, simple events can have a great impact later on in life. However, life is not as dynamic and non-linear as it is believed to be so by several people. In fact, it is largely predictable as well as causal with only some element of uncertainty.

The problem lies with the years of stereotypes that get passed down from batches to batches across colleges, that if someone gets placed in Company ABC, he’s a stud. People should understand that most of the companies that decide the fate of students every year come with their own set of biases, limited interview panels decided by a couple of hours’ slot allotted to them, and flawed managers who make wrong decisions through their ‘gut-feeling’ which can be influenced by a multitude of factors known only to them. So, why give so much importance to the outcome of such a deeply flawed system?
Therefore, even if you don’t get placed in your dream company, or don’t hit the target CTC you had in mind, it’s alright! People have gotten bored, frustrated, or burnt-out with what they felt were their dream jobs way sooner than they ever expected.

But the fact that those who get ‘lucky’ in such a system accelerate ahead of others cannot be denied. However, this acceleration is short-lasting as things balance out as everyone moves ahead professionally and those who really are good stay ahead of the rest!

`def. causal - adjective: having a cause-effect relationship`

2. Don’t let the initial months of excitement let you redefine your goals
=====
When I started working 2 years ago, my objective was to apply for an MS in the US and quit my current job as soon as possible. However, the initial few months were so good in terms of learning, exposure, and building false hopes that I dropped the original idea of an MS and instead switched towards going for an MBA after a couple more years of work experience in the renewable energy sector. This would have been an ideal profile for an MBA candidate.




Aren't headings cool?
